# UFOs
## Overview
In this project we have taken a JavaScript object containing data of UFO sightings at various dates and places, and created a webpage that allows the user to filter these results by date, city, state, country, and shape of the object. This webpage also gives a short introduction to the topic and the data. All of the code and webpages for the challenge specifically can be found in the "Challenge" folder.

## Results
In order to use this webpage to sort through the results, Dana needs to go to the left side of the webpage. There, she can enter in whatever search parameters she is looking to filter her data by entering in any one of the textboxes as seen below:

For example, if she wants to filter El Cajon, CA, she would enter in these paramaters as shown below and get these results:

Thus, she can find whatever specific UFO information she needs from this website for her research.

## Summary
One drawback of this way of viewing the data is that the viewer has to really know what they are looking for to find it. It's also currently a little difficult to visualize the data as a whole and draw conclusions from that data. One way to improve this could be to create a map of these UFO sightings. This could allow the user to not only see a better idea of where these UFO sightings are commonly occurring as well as giving the user some good search parameters to start with. Another improvement could be to make the filtering a little more user-friendly. This could come from making sure that the filter parameters aren't case-sensitive. There are no upper-case results in the data, so if a user enteres a filter with upper case, such as "CA", there will be no results. With these improvements, the website will be more user-friendly, and allow the user to visualize the data better.
